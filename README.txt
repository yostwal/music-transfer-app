Use Case:
    I want to stream music on my friend's phone via Bluetooth, even if his phone is out of range from my device. 
    
How:
    The music transfer app finds and connects a mobile device within range, which in turn connects to other device and so on, until a "network" is established between my phone and my friend's phone.
